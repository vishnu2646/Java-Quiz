🌟 **Just Completed My First Java Project!** 🌟

 I'm excited to share that I've just wrapped up my first project in Java Quiz Application! 🎉

🔧 **𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁:**

  - A console-based quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions.

  - The quiz features five questions, each with four possible answers.

  - The questions and answers were initially hard-coded, but I later refactored the code to read them from a JSON file, making the application more dynamic and scalable.

💡 **Key Learnings:**

  - **𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁-𝗢𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴:** Implemented classes and objects to represent quiz questions and options.

  - **𝗝𝗦𝗢𝗡 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴:** Integrated the Jackson library to handle JSON data, which was a great introduction to working with external libraries in Java.

  - **𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:** Learned about handling resources like Scanner and ensuring they are properly closed to avoid memory leaks.

  - **𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴:** Encountered and resolved issues like the "Resource leak" warning and the "Cannot construct instance" error, which deepened my understanding of Java's error handling mechanisms.

🚀 **Next Steps:**

  - I plan to enhance this project by adding more features, such as feedback, time tracking, and perhaps a graphical user interface.

  - I’m excited to continue exploring Java and further my skills in software development.
